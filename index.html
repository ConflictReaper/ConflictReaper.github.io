				This project strives towards understanding and improving collaboration in cloud storage services.

				Background
			</h2>
			<p style="line-height: 2em; text-indent: 2em">
				Recently, cloud storage services provide the users with advanced functions of collaborative file editing -- a shared file is simultaneously edited by multiple collaborators.
				For transparency and user-friendliness, today’s cloud storage services do not ask users to use version control systems; instead, they implement their own heuristics for dealing with conflicts.
				The transparency, however, is also a weakness, as some existing practices may lead to unexpected and undesired experiences, such as wired conflicts (listed in Table 1). 
				In this project, we attempt to investigate the underlying reasons for these anomalies and propose practical solutions.
			</p>
			<!--<p>
				The functionality of cloud storage services has evolved from simple file backup to online collaboration.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the ease of use, file collaboration is made transparent by almost all the cloud storage services today through automatic file synchronization.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, collaboration inevitably introduces conflicts -- unexpected and even mysterious events.

			<h2>
				Summary of Our Findings
			</h2>
			<p style="line-height: 2em; text-indent: 2em">
				Our study leads to a number of findings that explain the unexpected and undesired patterns described in Table 1.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Majority of the mainstream cloud storage services do not use any form of locking to prevent conflicts. 
					<!--The other three services use coarse-grained file-level locks (Seafile only supports it for Microsoft Office files). 
					None of these services support line-level locks (commonly in version control systems). 
					Moreover, we find that the locking is done often too early or too late.-->
				</li>
				<li>
					Resolving conflicts is painful. 
					<!--Although resolving conflicts is seldom considered pleasant, the current practices of existing cloud storage services make it worse. 
					Specifically, Google Drive only keeps the latest version (based on server-side timestamps) of all the conflicted versions. 
					iCloud Drive asks users to choose one version from all the conflicted versions. 
					The other six services distribute all the conflicted versions to all the collaborators, which may potentially cause a merging storm.-->
				</li>
				<li>
					Many of the undesired experiences are caused by the poor implementation of message queues at the cloud side. 
					<!--We observe that the queuing time of five cloud storage services could be excessive in certain scenarios, indicating that they are using a shared queue. 
					When the queue is overloaded, the file synchronization time becomes unpredictable. 
					To make the matter worse, the time order between file updates could be broken.-->
				</li>
				<li>
					Combining full-file sync and delta sync to update different sizes of files outperforms a single method. 
					<!--We observe that NutStore adopts full-file sync for small (<= 64 KB) files and delta sync for larger files, which outperforms other services using either full-file sync or delta sync.-->
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>
				Optimizations
			</h2>
			<p style="line-height: 2em; text-indent: 2em">
				Driven by the findings, we propose two optimizations which are fully compatible with the workflow and system architecture of existing cloud storage services (cf. Figure 1):
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A file-level editing lock based on file editing status is a better option than the hard-coded locks used by some of the existing cloud storage services. 
					<!--The editing lock automatically takes effect and notifies users when a shared file is being edited by collaborators. 
					It prevents the problems of “too early” or “too late” locking. 
					Note that the editing lock is in-situ during file editing, and is fundamentally different from notifications postmortem to file changes.-->
				</li>
				<li>
					The client should actively fetch the latest version of a collaborative file from the cloud before editing. 
					<!--As this fetch is critical in avoiding conflicts, it should be differently treated with QoS guarantee (e.g., implemented with a dedicated queue). 
					Most of the Web APIs provided by the cloud storage services can be leveraged to achieve this.-->
				</li>

				Enabling conflict-free collaborations with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ConflictReaper/ConflictReaper">ConfilctReaper</a>
			</h2>
			<p style="line-height: 2em; text-indent: 2em">
				Integrated aforementioned optimizations, we build ConflictReaper to assist existing cloud storage services in a fully transparent and automatic manner.
				ConflictReaper is agnostic to the cloud-side implementation and is generically applicable to existing cloud storage services.
				We implement and issue the Windows version of ConflictReaper (with architecture in Figure 2). 
				The real-world experiment shows that it prevents 91% conflicts overall.
